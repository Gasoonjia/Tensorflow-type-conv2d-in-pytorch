# Tensorflow-type-conv2d-in-pytorch  
I added some tensorflow element in pytorch Conv2d, like padding='SAME'.  
  
You can also use it as normal conv2d in pytorch.  
  
Great thanks to to @famssa in 'https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/3867' and @Oldpan in 'https://github.com/Oldpan/faceswap-pytorch' and https://oldpan.me/archives/pytorch-same-padding-tflike.
